/* Lecture
Stacks and Queues for infix to postfix, understand how to evaluate an expression
No negative or over single digit numbers for infix to postfix questions
Example: (2+3)*4 -> 23+4*
Possible question: Reverse a string using a stack... input: string, data
structure used: stack

Queue: Priority Queue implemented using heap... i did not do it this way on the
lab Queue as array and Queue as linked list Stack as Array and Stack as linked
list Template Queue vs Template Stack

Sorting: Time complexity, space complexity, Quicksort not stable
Heap: Tracing heapify, Heapsort, implementing heapify
