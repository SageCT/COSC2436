If you're looking for a job as a graphic designer, you'll need to have a portfolio.
There are many different ways to create a portfolio, but the best way is to create a website.
It should be a free site, so users can view your portfolio without having to pay.
You can create a website with a CMS, like WordPress or Drupal. You can also create a site without a CMS, like Joomla, or simply make your own website with HTML.
"Hello, World" is often the first program of any new computer user.
This program was originally a terminal program that displayed the first line of a text file, and the text "Hello, World!" to any computer user who typed in the command.
The computer user was able to see this text on the screen because the computer terminal was connected to a computer monitor.
The terminal program was replaced later by graphical user interfaces.
